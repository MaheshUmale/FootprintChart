This file outlines the remaining steps to complete the footprint chart implementation. The primary blocker at the time of this commit was a persistent environment issue preventing the Flask application from starting, which needs to be resolved before proceeding.

**Remaining Steps:**

1.  **Diagnose and Fix the Environment Issue:**
    *   The Flask application (`app/app.py`) fails to start, often timing out without clear error messages. This needs to be the first priority.
    *   **Action:** Start the Flask server in the foreground (`python app/app.py`) and debug any errors that appear. The issue seems to be with the core environment, as even a minimal Flask app failed to run consistently. Ensure all dependencies from `requirements.txt` are correctly installed and that there are no port conflicts on port 5003.

2.  **Generate a Screenshot with Dummy Data for Review:**
    *   Once the application can run, the next step is to generate a visual sample of the chart for the user to approve.
    *   **Action:**
        a.  Temporarily modify `app/app.py` to use the dummy data generator. Comment out the `upstox_thread.start()` line and uncomment the `socketio.start_background_task(generate_dummy_data)` line in the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block.
        b.  Start the application in the background: `python app/app.py &`
        c.  Run the verification script to take a screenshot: `python /home/jules/verification/verify_chart.py`. This script will click the "Replay Chart" button and wait for data to be rendered.
        d.  Review the generated screenshot at `/home/jules/verification/footprint_chart.png` to ensure it looks correct.

3.  **Restore Live Data Connection:**
    *   After the user approves the screenshot, the application must be returned to its live data configuration.
    *   **Action:**
        a.  In `app/app.py`, restore the live WebSocket connection by uncommenting the `upstox_thread.start()` line and removing or commenting out the `socketio.start_background_task(generate_dummy_data)` line.
        b.  Ensure the `ACCESS_TOKEN` placeholder in `app/app.py` is replaced with a valid token for the live connection to work.

4.  **Final Pre-Commit Verification and Submission:**
    *   With the live application running, perform a final round of verification.
    *   **Action:**
        a.  Run through the pre-commit checklist one last time (`pre_commit_instructions`).
        b.  Since the UI is involved, a final `frontend_verification_complete` call with an updated screenshot is required.
        c.  Once all checks pass, submit the completed work with a descriptive commit message.
